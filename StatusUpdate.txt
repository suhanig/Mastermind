Today I spent my time expanding on what I had. I made my code so that instead of only printing out 2 rows, it is able to now print out 20 due to a for loop I included in my mastermind class. I also added on so that the player was able to enter 10 guesses instead of just 1. I made it so that they could added the guess into every other row of the 20 rows. I also was able to have the previous guess of the user remin in the format as they enter in their next guess.
