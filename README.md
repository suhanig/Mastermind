# Mastermind

From Wikipedia: Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game for two players. The modern game with pegs was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert.[1][2] It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back a century or more.

# Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, Orange, Purple
# Scoring Black, White

Mastermind.  (Main.java class if using Repl.it but ok)
*Make Build Board class
** here the board is constructed and the layout is set up
** wanted to have my scoring on 2 different lines

** [B, R, Y, G, =, bl, wh]
** [ , , , , =, wh, bl]


*Make a rules class
**gives rules at beginning (could be a method call printRules() )


*Make secret code class
** allows for computer top generate random secret code that the user is trying to guess

*Make user input class
**Scanner class - input user prompts, etc
**checks to see if player should recieve black or white pin

* Not doing this below yet
**?PvP = play1 choses secret code (swap places at keyboard)
***play2 - takes turn guessing
**?PvC	= play1 - computer randomizes colors and location of pins				
***play2 - takes turn guessing

|  | PROS| CONS |
|Ints|-simple to code | -translate back and forth |
|   |		     |-might be confusing to player|
|chars| -less confusion for player | -a bit more code to learn |	 

*Arrays - 1-2D array for player guesses
	**1-1D array for the secret code
	
	
	

Writeup on this project: 
I think the biggest challenge/frustration I Had was with generating a secret code and ananlyzing/comparing the user input to said code. I was able to use my knowledge of arrays in building the board. The most trouble I had was with all of the for loops. I had to play around and tweak things a lot to just have one of my for loops going. I do think that this project took a lot of work, but I enjoyed it and I am glad we were able to complete it. If I were to further develop this, I would make this a 2 player game, where one player enters a secret code and the other guesses. I would also like to make my output look neater and more aesthetic in general. However, with how miuch we have worked on this project, I have been able to make a running code and gotten past the challenges. I overcame these challenges by working on this project during my freebells with Mr. Twyford, with collaborating with peers, and by doing my own research with websites such as W3.
